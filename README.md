What is guweb?
------

guweb is the front-facing appearance of the osu! server protocol, [bancho.py](https://github.com/cmyui/bancho.py)!
Using native async/await syntax written on top of [Quart](https://github.com/pgjones/quart) and
[cmyui's multipurpose library](https://github.com/cmyui/cmyui_pkg), guweb achieves flexability, cleanliness,
and efficiency not seen in other frontend implementations - all while maintaining the simplicity of Python.

Requirements
------

- Some know-how with Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04), Python, and general-programming knowledge.
- MySQL
- NGINX
- NodeJS

Setup
------

Setup is relatively simple - these commands should set you right up.

Notes:

- Ubuntu 20.04 is known to have issues with NGINX and osu! for unknown reasons?
- If you have any difficulties setting up guweb, feel free to join the Discord server at the top of the README, we now have a bit of a community!

```sh
# Install Python >=3.9 and latest version of PIP.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-dev python3.9-distutils
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.9 get-pip.py && rm get-pip.py

# Install MySQL and NGINX.

sudo apt install mysql-server nginx


# Install Nodejs and npm or yarn
# see https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .

# Clone guweb from GitHub.
git clone https://github.com/varkaria/guweb.git
cd guweb

# Initialize and update the submodules.
git submodule init && git submodule update

# Install requirements from pip.
python3.9 -m pip install -r ext/requirements.txt


# Add and configure guweb's NGINX config to your nginx/sites-enabled.
sudo ln -r -s ext/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/guweb.conf
sudo nano ext/nginx.conf
sudo nginx -s reload


# Configure guweb.
cp ext/config.sample.py config.py
nano config.py

# Configure locales
cp config.sample.js config.js
# edit the copied file to meet yor needs


# build locales
npm run i18n:build 
# or use yarn
yarn i18n:c

# Run guweb (on port 8000).
python3.9 main.py # Run directly to access debug features for development!
hypercorn main.py # Please run guweb with hypercorn when in production! It will improve performance drastically by disabling all of the debug features a developer would need!
```

Prepare Locales
------

### requirements

- VSCode (recommend)
- VSCode plugin: i18n-ally (recommend)
- Node
  
### prepare

`npm install -D`

### how to

- open any html files with i18n-ally plugin enabled.
- translate keys
- run `npm run i18n:build` to generate files for python-i18n

The End

Well know that you know everything, why not check out the original code guweb was based off of in [this](https://github.com/yo-ru/gulag-web) i think i should continue this work to finish work?
